# SosADL-Melange
Project for sharing issues

DO NOT build the projects using Eclipse builder, it will take hour!
Instead, there are 2 scripts (windows or linux, pick ur choice), configure the Oracle builder (there are already one there, just fix your javac path) and use it to build.

When generating EMF infrastructure, generate from org.archware.sosadl.model/TypeCheckerHelper.ecore
Generate just the model, to create files, just create an empty file with a .sosadl or .sos extension.

Email me if you got any problem with the projects eduafsilva@gmail.com
