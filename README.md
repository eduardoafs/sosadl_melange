DO NOT build the projects using Eclipse builder, it will take hour!
Instead, there are 2 scripts (windows or linux, pick ur choice), configure the Oracle builder (there are already one there, just fix your javac path) and use it to build.
As soon as you open your Eclipse, uncheck Build > Build projects automatically. Even with the oracle builder is kinda annoying to building after any change, it still takes a few seconds (around 12 seconds in my machine).

When generating EMF infrastructure, generate from org.archware.sosadl.model/TypeCheckerHelper.ecore
Generate just the model, to create files, just create an empty file with a .sosadl or .sos extension.

Email me if you got any problem with the projects eduafsilva@gmail.com
